给定 "pwwkew" ，
子串是pww,wwk等很多个子串 是连在一起的
子序列是 pwk,pke等很多个子序列 ，但是子序列中的字符在字符串中不一定是连在一起的。

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.



Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).

Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.

Return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of A and B:  answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, else answer[i] = 1. 
Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: seq = "(()())"
Output: [0,1,1,1,1,0]
Example 2:

Input: seq = "()(())()"
Output: [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= seq.size <= 10000
